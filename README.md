### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use a font with the @font-face property, which I previously did not know existed! 

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter';
    src: url(./assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt\,wght.ttf);
}
```

### Continued development

I tried using rem instead of pixels, but as it was a slight disaster and it took ages to get to a decent result I guess I have to keep practicing!

### Useful resources

- [using fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp) - This helped me because I didn't have the slightest idea what to do with the font file provided in the starter file. 
- [image not showing on browser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8705823/image-showing-up-in-vs-design-mode-but-not-in-browser) - This helped me fix the user avatar image not appearing on broswer by adding a dot before the image path, although to be honest I have no idea why the solution works.
